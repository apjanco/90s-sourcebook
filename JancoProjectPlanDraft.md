# Learning Activity 3. Plan First: Needs Assessment and Design Plan for Class Project.

## Step 1. Identify Project
Decide on your project for this course. Record your project contact name(s), and contact information, URL (if any). Email this project information to diane.kovacs@gmail.com for approval before continuing. 
Begin creating your needs assessment and design plan. Outline the general scope of the project including:

1. the history of the organization and their current web site(s) (if any), <br>
 I am interested in working with a group of graduate students at NYU and Columbia that are working to create a post-Soviet multimedia sourcebook.  
 They have an intitial site that they created on [Squarespace](www.postSoviet90s.com). 
 
2. the purpose of the web site and its intended audience<br>
  The sourcebook will be a resource for teaching the history and media culture of the post-Soviet 1990s. 
   
3. The type of information and services that the client wants on the web site and the nature of this information (does the information change often, how could you best chunk the information for different audiences, do they have existing information that could be converted to web content?, etc.<br>
  The group has pointed to 17 Moments in Soviet History as an example of what they would like the end-product to look like.  
  This site will be an open-source set of materials for teaching and individual learning. 
   
4. the client's priorities in designing the web site<br>
  As a member of SlavicDH (our affiliate group of the Association for Slavic, East European, & Eurasian Studies), I am helping to organize a workshop in Boston that will introduce scholars to the project, train them in the skills needed to contribute to the project, and beging working on potential contributions to the Sourcebook.  

5. who will maintain the web site once it has been drafted?.<br>
  The project will have long term support from  SlavicDH for hosting and development. 

## Step 2. Identify Need
Describe the need or purpose that this project would fulfill. What are your goals and intentions for this project?
Is there a need for a particular library (or other organization) web site? or What are the goals of the page? Are you trying to Impress, Promote, or Attract?

1. Brainstorm ideas to obtain maximum number of goals.<br>
  The group's main goal is to feature a limited number of cultural objects that exemplify specific aspects of post-Soviet media culture.  They want to be highly selective in their items and to provide high quality metadata and commentary.
  The group is currently composed on a small "core" group of students on the NEH grant.  They are not interested in building a larger community around the project. This should be seen mostly as an e-book.
  The group is relatively conservative in their design choices and prefer the site to be familiar to a traditional academic audience.
   
2. Obtain consensus on the Goals: Share the goals  with other interested people - colleagues, users, etc. - to get their feedback; alter the goals, then re-review until everyone agrees (obtain consensus) that these are the goals for your web site.<br>
I scheduled a meeting, but not everyone was able to attend.  I will have a more complete answer to this question once I am back from travelling on Oct. 7th and can arrange a new talk. 
3. Goal Analysis: Are the goals measurable? Will you be able to observe or inquire with users how they are using the web site? How will you measure? Number of visits? Completion of measurable activities? Has someone been doing this already? and will they share their data with you?<br>
  Analytics can be used to study how users engage with the site.  We should hope for behaviors where users proceed page-by-page through a source.  We should be particularly attentive if users are only hitting the home page or click through the pages without taking time to read the content.  We should expect "book-reading" type behaviors where users proceed through the content and take time to read. 
  We can offer an anonymous survey to gather users' impressions of the site.  Does it feel intuitive?  Are they satisfied with the quality of the content as teaching material?  

## Step 3. Identify Users
Who are the intended potential or current users of your web site?

1. Are they children or adults? Are they subject experts or individuals who come to the site to learn? Are they students, faculty, staff, members of the general public, business or medical professionals, researchers? etc.<br>
  Currently, the main use case will be students and teachers using the site as a course reading. 
  Students should expect stable and useful URLs, clear text and simple tools for playing multimedia content. 
  Professors will expect the site to be very modular.  Parts of the site can be assigned as individual readings, sections can be assigned, the site should also be useful as a reference 
  for students not specifically assigned readings or researching an associated topic.  

2. How are your users expecting to use the web site? e.g.., for reference, for education, recreation, business? or conversely: How would you like your users to use the web site?<br>
  User will likely expect the site to be relatively transparent and serve as access to sources and analysis. There is little room for creativity or innovation in design or presentation. 
  However, given that the site is intended to engage youth, there is some need for bright and contemporary styling. 
  
3. What do the users already know? e.g., how to use the web , content subject matter, etc.<br>
  Users are likely to have an existing interest in media studies, post-Soviet culture and the web.  The site should be multi-lingual with translations of image content in English and translations of commentary in Russian.   


## Step 4. Identify Style/Persona
What is the "style" or "persona" associated with the current users, the organization, or potential users of the web site?

1. What kinds of colors, graphics, or logos are used by the interested parties on other publication media? e.g., children may prefer a style with larger fonts, brighter colors, etc. Some users may feel more comfortable with dramatic color combinations and graphics, others may feel more comfortable with simplicity. Users who will be reading text on the web site may be grateful for clear white backgrounds, high contrast, and readable font sizes/types. etc.<br>
The current site is very simplistic.  The futura font is highly readable and non-distracting. There is a gray background (#FCFCFC). 
I've been experimenting with a variable font called ["Starla."](https://www.napoleontypefaces.de/typefaces/starla) It has some Russian-like characters that could be good for communicating the cultural context of the materials.


2. Do you need to consider the needs of users who speak Spanish, Hmong, or other language in addition to English?<br>
Yes, Russian-language users should be considered. 
 
3. Ask users and organization staff for their "ideal". What would they like to see - then moderate it with what you know of readability, your actual graphics or multimedia skills, and good taste.<br>
  Based on the current site and 17 Moments, I have drafted a simple site with a Bootstrap navbar, search bar, and image slider.  Initial response from the group was favorable.
  

# Learning Activity 4. Design Next: Needs Assessment and Design Plan for Class Project.

## Step 1. Identify Project (1 sentence to remind your teacher):

## Step 2. Content
Where will your content come from? Will it be original writing? graphics? multi-media? Who will supply these? Are you collecting links to web resources and annotating them? Writing promotional pieces about organizational services? Creating tutorials and research guides? Explain your basic content.

The current site has a variety of images and links to videos on YouTube.  There is also small sections of text written by the sourcebook group.  These bits of text will likely be expanded into large multi-page essays with illustrations. 
There is currently no copyright attribution or indication where the images were taken from.

## Step 3. Layout and Navigation

Using paper and pencil - graph paper* is best - draw a picture of how you would like to layout your page. You can use layout software if you prefer but there is no need to do so. Laying out the pages this way will give you a good sense of what you'll need to do to 'make it so' when you create your external CSS file. To turn in the paper and pencil layout, scan i, save it as a pdf, and upload the file.

Draw or type up a diagram or flowchart for how your web site will be organized and how users will navigate through the pages. Some designers refer to this diagram as a Site Map or a Mindmap of your web site. Your mindmap/flowchart for navigation can be very simple and written in pencil or pen on paper or whatever recording method works best for you. Some web -designers swear by a program called Visio. There is no need to be fancy unless you want to, or want to use your mindmap/flowchart for navigation as part of your completed web site. Answer these questions in planning for navigation:

1. Your main/agenda/organizer page will set the expectations for layout and navigation for your users. Given your content, and the style you want to achieve, how would you layout the main page? two columns, two columns with a header and footer? Three columns?, random css boxes(aka layers, div id's, information containers, content holders, etc.)
I expect to have a navbar with search field.  Navbar categories will have dropdowns.  There will be linked to switch between Russian and English.
There will be a slider with attention grabbing images and links to general categories of the collection. 
A footer will contain credits and links to social media.

2. How will you plan for navigation from that page to sub-pages and then between the sub-pages and back to the main page? Clickable index? Menu? How many navigation options in the index or menu? How will you achieve consistency between pages?
The same navbar.html and footer.html blocks will be included on all pages for consistency of the theme. 

## Step 4. Style, Colors, Fonts

This is the step where you will decide what your web site will look like. Choose colors, fonts, graphical devices, etc., to use and apply to navigational features. Remember simplicity and consistency enhance access to your web -based materials.  You can change it later but what do you plan for now:

1. What is the general style you have decided on? Will it be formal, scholarly, bookish, or fun, vibrant, entertaining, classic, zen, elegant, or dramatic, powerful, innovative? Describe.
  The site will be simple, sophisticated, and design-savy, while also being scholarly and bookish. 

2. What color scheme will you use and how? e.g., colors for headings, reading text, links etc.


3. What fonts and text styles will you use? Decide on text styles to indicate different textual elements: e,g, italics for emphasis or bolding for keyterms, underlining for links etc. and use consistently. Why?
  I am considering ["Starla"](https://www.napoleontypefaces.de/typefaces/starla) for the navbar.
  Other text content will be in [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) regular and Roboto regular for titles and headings.  

4. Choose or create navigational terms (back, forward, next, etc.) or graphics (buttons, arrows, etc. ) that are used consistently. What kinds of navigational elements will you use? Why?
  The navbar will be the same on every page for consistency and ease of navigation.

5. Choose or create "information graphics" to illustrate or provide information about the content of your page. What ideas do you have for these? What will these be used for specifically?

6. Choose or create "decorative graphics". Will you include decorative graphics? Why? Will these help to create the style you want? How?


# Learning Activity 5. Implement Last. Repeat: Needs Assessment and Design Plan for Class Project.

## Step 1. Where will your Site be hosted? and Who will be the Web Administrator?

1. Who is or will be the Web server administrator for your site? If you don't know, do you know how to find out?
  The web-site will be running on a Digital Ocean VM (droplet) running Ubuntu 18.  I will act as administrator and have root access to the server.

2. How will you establish communications with the Web server administrator?
  Digital Ocean is a "bare bones" community-driven infrastructure company.  They do not provide customer support, but they have an active community of tutorial writers and user discussion boards. 

## Step 2. Will you be using a Content Management System (CMS) or Template (e.g., Weebly, Wordpress...)?
  Following the example of the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities site that I reviewed earlier, I am interested in trying Mezzanine as a CMS layer for Django.  This will allow users to manage content on their own.  This is possible using Django's flat-pages app, but it uses Django's native admin interface.  Mezzanine creates a WordPress-like dashboard. 

1. How often will you review your web site organization?
  One of our students recently read a book on *Test-driven Development in Python*.  I'm only half-way through the book, but it should be possible to add functional tests to the site with Selenium.  This will confirm that the site is operating as designed and send alerts when problems arise.   

2. Who will be involved in review?
  Given that this is a prototype site, there will be regular communication with the Sourcebook group.  We could certainly schedule regular check-ins to review the site.

3. How will upgrades to software be decided? Who will be responsible?
  As a the server admin, I will be responsible for making decisions to update Django, Ubuntu and other elements of the project. 

## Step 3. Who will be creating and/or adding or updating Content?

1. How frequently will you collect, select, and evaluate information resources to add to your site?
  The Sourcebook group in currently thinking of this as a publication, not unlike a book.  They'd like to curate roughly 100 items for the site and then consider the project complete. 
  Once the Source book is "published," the content will remain relatively stable.   

2. Who will be responsible for collecting, selecting, and evaluating information resources?
  The Sourcebook group will determine editorial policies and choose the editorial staff. It is clear from our interactions, that the group is not interested in working 
  with SlavicDH as collaborators.  We are a resource and facilitator, not an author. 

3. Who will be responsible for adding links or content or apps to the Web pages or CMS?
  Mezzanine will allow users to add and update content without further interaction from me. 

4. How will you gather feedback and evaluation from users of your web site? Will you respond? How will you use their suggestions in maintaining and growing your web site?
  The About section will list my name and email as a resource when technical problems arrise with the site. 

## Step 4. Who will be maintaining your site? And How?

1. What tools will you use to check links? How will you schedule manual/visual review of links and annotations?
  As noted earlier, I will use Django's native testing tools for unit testing and Selenium for functional testing. 

2. Who will be responsible for reviewing links and related content regularly? How much time will be allowed?
  Site functionality will be monitored automatically, the editors from the Sourcebook group will supervise content.
