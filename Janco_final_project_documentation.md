## Final Project Documentation 

This project was a website to facilitate the work of a workshop at the Association for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) meeting in Boston.  The event took place on the morning of December 6th at the Marriot Copley Place.  The event was a collaboration between member of the ASEEES Digital Humanities affiliate organization (SlavicDH) and a group of scholars planning a 1990s Multimedia Sourcebook.  The ongoing discussions and points of difference between these two groups was a very productive and helpful learning experience.  For example, the Sourcebook group originally requested a meeting space for a small group of investigators listed on their NEH grant applications.  SlavicDH imagined more of a hackathon where participants could engage with the Sourcebook, test new ideas and help in community development.  Given that the Sourcebook already had a "core" group of investigators, the contributions of SlavicDH shifted.  Instead of a hackathon, we planned an event where participants would engage with some of the design and research questions facing the Sourcebook group.  The discussions would be instructive for both participants and the Sourcebook, but we were focued much more on planning than on implimentation.  The focus of my webdesign shifted from building the Sourcebook to creating a website to facilitate the work of the workshop and to showcase possible tools and methods that could help to re-imagine the Sourcebook project as both a resource for teaching and DH research. 

To that end, the site includes:
  - 3,136 scans from a Soviet book journal.  Text was extracted from all the images using Google Vision. [See here](http://104.236.220.106/all-kos/)
  - [Bestsellers Lists](http://104.236.220.106/bestsellers/) were added from a spreadsheet provided by Bradley Gorski.  A simple network visualization was created using D3. 
  - Metadata was generated using the Distant Viewing Toolkit for a 20 minute compilation of television commercials from post-Soviet Russia. [See here](http://104.236.220.106/distant_viewing/)
  - Pages were created for each workshop session to allow instructors to post materials in advance for their session.  Here are links for the [Image session](http://104.236.220.106/image/) and [Text analysis](http://104.236.220.106/text/) sessions. 

- assess how well the redesigned web site met the goals of the client and how well it demonstrates (or fails to demonstrate) principles of good web page design.

- document/describe the files that have been changed (or will need to be changed)

- give instructions for modifying/changing the site in general terms of design

- mention any details that will be important to the client in understanding the design/redesign and ongoing maintenance of the site - Not teaching them HTML5 or JavaScript or CSS*.

- concludes with a self-reflection** - recognizing the limits of time and that you are still learning web design and coding skills: What was the most successful part of the redesign and why? What was the least successful part of the redesign? If you had a second chance to redesign the web site, what changes would you incorporate? What was the best/worst part of the redesign process? What would you do differently? What challenges did you encounter in working with a client to carry out their vision?

- Post a note in the "Online text" field - with the correct URL for the pages (html, css, graphics files), OR upload a pdf/doc/txt file for your Final Project Documentation to the Moodle assignment tool for this learning activity, to receive credit for completion and feedback from the teacher.
